```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown


```{r cars}
x<-c(3,4,5,6,7)

mean(x)

y<-c(4,5,6,7,8)

add <-function(x,y){
  
  x+y
}

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
